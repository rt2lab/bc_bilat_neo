# Genome-scale analyses on pre and post NAC samples from 6 patients
# Of 50 patients with sBBCs treated with NAC, frozen material of sufficient quality was available in 6 patients 
# to perform tumor/normal whole exome sequencing (WES) and tumor RNA sequencing (RNAseq) in both left and right pre and post NAC samples 
# (including one patient with a multicentric bilateral breast cancer (Extended Fig5, TableS9). 
#   The total number of samples was 20 (pre-NAC: n =14; post-NAC: n=6) and this cohort was further used for all the genome scales analyses, 
#   both at the DNA and the RNA level. 
#   Germline pathogenic mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes were identified in four patients (BRCA1, n=2, BRCA2, n=2). 
#   Among the 14 primary tumors (PT), 9 were of luminal subtype and 5 were TNBCs. 
#   All patients received standard sequential anthracyclines-cyclophosphamide followed by taxanes. 
#   After NAC completion, 6 out of 14 tumors had residual disease (RD), while 8 tumors reached pCR. 
#
